Data Process engg on GCP

1. Injection  - different services and data formats
2. Process - different services and data formats
3. Store the output 
4. Visualize the output 
-----------------------------------
	different service on google cloud


python 
SQL 

Before cloud - this was on Premises 
	it use to be using softwares

	Hadoop -- 
		HDFS cluster (Storage)
		Mapreduces (Process)
		Yarn 
	To process this in more faster manner
	Spark and Hive was introduced (Process and Storage)
		PySpark (for python developers)
		PySQL (for SQL Developers)
------------------------
	Problem - there was a lot of challenge to manintain the infrastructure

	This set up was than taken to cloud

	which turned out to be

	-- Cloud Storage (can store data instead of HDFS cluster)
	-- dataproc (Hadoop with spark) - submit pyspark and pysql jobs
		injest the data
		process the data
		store the data
		
	Good thing 
		it is a cluster environment - so no need to worry about execution - Scalability 
		can pick the data from anywhere
		can store the data in anywhere
		can work with any format of data
	Sad thing
		did not had its own storage (like HDFS in Hadoop)
		engginer needs to know some language like python
		missing UI to get the data and store the data
		missing visualization integration 

-------
	Thus we had a better service then which solves all the above problems
	BigQuery
		has its own storage (Dataware house)
		can process the data - clean the data, calculate, format, validate etc...
		can store the data with itself as well as at other places
		visualization (Looker)

1. Injection  - different services and data formats
		 (bucket) CSV Files,JSON,Avro, Parquet, SQL (RDBMS)
		 Cloud SQL
			MySQL
			SQL Server
			Postgres
		 Cloud Spanner
		
		 PubSub (this is not a database - messageing service)
		 FireStore / Datastore - NoSQL storage
		 AlloyDB - Postgres (RDBMS)
		
		
2. Process - different services and data formats
3. Store the output 
4. Visualize the output
