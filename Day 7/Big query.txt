BigQuery's architecture is a serverless, decoupled storage and compute environment, enabling independent scaling of both resources. This allows for efficient and cost-effective data warehousing, particularly for large datasets. Key aspects of the architecture include: 
1. Decoupled Storage and Compute:
Storage:
BigQuery utilizes a columnar storage format and compression algorithms to store data in Google's Colossus system. Colossus handles replication, recovery, and distributed management, ensuring data availability and reliability. 
Compute:
BigQuery employs Dremel, a powerful query engine, for processing data. This engine, along with Borg, a cluster management system, allocates compute resources and handles fault tolerance. 
2. High-Speed Network:
Google's high-speed network connects the storage and compute layers, facilitating efficient communication and data transfer. This allows for fast query processing and data analysis.
3. Columnar Storage:
BigQuery uses a columnar storage structure, which is highly efficient for running SQL queries on large datasets. This approach enables faster data retrieval and analysis.
4. Scalability and Cost-Effectiveness:
The serverless architecture allows for independent scaling of storage and compute resources, enabling users to manage their resources and costs effectively. 
BigQuery automatically optimizes data partitioning and sharding, further improving query performance and reducing costs. 
5. Data Management and Security:
BigQuery provides features for data partitioning, clustering, and indexing to optimize query performance and reduce costs. 
It also offers robust security measures to protect sensitive data. 
In essence, BigQuery's architecture is designed to handle large-scale data processing tasks with speed, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. By decoupling storage and compute, utilizing a columnar storage format, and leveraging Google's powerful infrastructure, BigQuery provides a robust platform for big data analytics.
