we needed more faster system to analyze the data


Hadoop -
	works great on  Data blocks (pre-collected data, settled data)
	not suitable for
	live data / streaming data

		we needed something to work on streaming, and needed more faster solution for data blocks


	mapreduce function was not easy for everyone
	we wanted something where sql like language or more easier language like scala and python can be used

	Thus Apache made/re-wrote the architecture and came with Spark, execution is 100 times faster than
	mapreduce
	also scala and python are integrated internally 
	also sql can be used further 

	so we have 
	scala environment if you want to use scala
	pyspark for people knowing python
	pysql for peple knowing sql 

	we now also have spark integrated with google cloud in a service called dataproc
