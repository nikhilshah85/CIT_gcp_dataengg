						Dataware House



--Facts
	No contraints - (expect primary key)
	No CRUD - insert, update and delete
	No Normalization but do a denormalization

	To do a denormalization we have techniques called as Schema technically

		-- Star schema  (this for mid complex level of data warehouse)
		-- Snowflake schema (for very large business and more complex system)

	No OLTP - This is OLAP 
	Databases had 2 dimention table - rows and cols

	2 types of tables exists here
		Dim (dimention) - 
		Fact (Fact - actual) - 
		
		Dim are the master tables (new data rarely gets generated)
			dimDept
			dimPersonalInfo
			dimCurrency
			dimRegion
		
		Fact are the parent table - where new data gets generated every second



-- is made up of 
    Dataset
