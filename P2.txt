					Global Sales Analysis

Design an ETL Pipeline to analyse the sales across different countries

Create a project for Sales analysis and give a forecasting for next month so management can take decisions for production of goods

An organization has offices in 8 countries and been selling various products through offices and partners

Organization has 5 categories of products and each category has 6 products each
Below are the categories
Tshirts, Jeans, Shoes, Smart Phone, Perfumes, Water bottles.

We collect their sales data every day through various Below sources

India - data is collected in SQL Server instance 
Japan - data in collected in an csv file in a storage bucket
Norway - data is collected in Postgres SQl in AlloyDB service
Sri Lanka - data is collected in JSON file in storage bucket (different bucket, not the same as Japan)
HongKong - data is collected in excel file 

Oman, Germany and Qatar we collect data in MySQL Instance - in 3 different databases
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We need to clean the data, transform the data, calculate and collate the data in 1 single storage - you can choose to store the data in a single format at 1 place

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

data from different countries comes in different formats (in English for our project purpose but in real it can come in different languages)

Below is the format we gave to offices to send us the data

SaleId Category Product Qty Sale

-----------------------------------------------------------------
You will prepare the data for 8 different countries, 200 records per source
Data will be in every countries own format for currency eg. Hongkong - store in HKD i.e 10.93
Keep price for every product between 500 and 1200
so when for India - Tshirt is 500rs it will be stored as 500/10.93 in data coming from Hongkon and similar for all the countries
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Data may also contain null values
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Final table will have all the data in INR format and without null values
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Analysis 

A.
1 of the stake holder needs to know the total qty of every product sold, we need to give him a google cloud link which will have PId, Pname, PCategory, QtySold, Price, Amount
	Give an excel/csv file link the owner will analyse the data himself

B. 1 of the stake holder wants to see the graphical presentation of various types based on category, country, etc...

C. Tax department needs to get the visuals and tables for tax payments, thus they need to see the sales
	countrywise, product wise, category wise, along with the tax value (consider 5%tax on every sale)

d. Plan some charts on your own which can be useful for various groups

e. Use single them for all the charts, use image of the some organization for and copyright information on the charts
